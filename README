This is the IndecentDynamo test repository. To install it, clone this repository into your web server's document root, i.e. /var/www. If you have config files already, make sure to copy them into volumizer/app/config/; if you're just starting, you'll have to modify the core.php and database.php files accordingly.

Before committing changes, be sure to run the command:
	git update-index --assume-unchanged volumizer/app/config/ volumizer/app/tmp/
so that your security seed, salt, and database configurations are not committed.
